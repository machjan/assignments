#Canon of Demographic Changes and Pensions
##Introduction
Just a few centuries ago, people all over the world had not many options regarding their old-age security. Savings were costly for most of the people because of limited access to capital markets (i.e. it was difficult for peasants to invest or to open a bank account) and there was no public system providing old-age benefits except for church charities. Therefore, a common way to secure own retirement was a large family where the young generation took care of the old, expecting the same from their own children in the future. Such a system could have some advantages (e.g. when each young generation was larger than the older one) but its risks and limits were obvious: for childless people, as well as for the young generation bound to its parents.

For these and other reasons, the public pension plans were established in many western countries at the beginning of the 20th century. The first public pension system is considered the old-age social insurance program introduced in 1989 in Germany by the chancellor Otto von Bismarck [(1)](https://www.ssa.gov/history/ottob.html). During the 20th century, the size of pension systems rose in many countries and the 2014 Net Replacement Rate (i.e. the individual pension entitlement divided by pre-retirement earnings) in OECD countries was 63% [(2)](https://data.oecd.org/pension/net-pension-replacement-rates.htm). Obviously, running such a large system leaded (and will lead) to many socio-economic consequences. For instance, as regards the traditional family pension security Galasso, Gatti, & Profeta (2009) argue that a more generous public pension system leads to lower fertility rates, as the economic importance of family is reduced. This effect is particularly strong in countries with less developed capital markets where the possibility to save and invest is limited [(3)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10797-009-9104-5). 

One of the often discussed spectres of our time is called “population ageing”. Population scientists are showing relentless statistics of a long-term decline in fertility below the replacement fertility rate in developed countries, populists are foretelling the end of the Western civilization and even politicians are timidly hinting inevitable changes in social policies. Like in most of the big social issues, also in this debate economists have some important points to say. Yet they are not heard adequately, perhaps due to the overly scientific and mathematical arguments they provide.

The goal of this canon is to rectify this oversight and to provide some general economic knowledge related to the ageing population issue in an understandable way. We have focused on one specific subtopic – the impact of current demographic changes on pensions. Specifically, all the troubles and inconveniences the aging population causes to current pension systems. Firstly, we provide a brief introduction to pension schemes as well as some facts about the demographic changes. Then we link these two areas and show the main implications, some possible solutions already applied or just discussed among economists and its close relation to government policies. In the end, we also relate all the above mentioned to the past, current and future situation in the Netherlands.

##Pension Systems
###Pay-as-you-go Pension (PAYG) Scheme
In the PAYG system, pensions are financed by current revenue of the government. A government does not need to accumulate savings for future generation’s pensions; it can tax the working population to cover the pensions of retirees. In this system, the pensions received by any generation do not necessarily equal to this generation’s contribution for pensions. This feature of the PAYG scheme mainly provides two tools to government. Government can redistribute resources across generations and share risks across generations.

###Funded Pension Scheme
In a fully funded pension system, pensions of retirees are financed by their own savings. Contributions (savings) of participants are invested in financial assets; when they are retired their pensions will be funded by all of their contributions in addition to returns (interest and dividends) to their contributions.  This pension scheme has two important characteristics. First, this system always has required resources to finance pensions in principle. Secondly, people are constrained with their own savings and the investment returns for their pensions unless additional redistributive policy is included to the system.

###Defined-Contribution Plans, Defined-Benefit Plans and Notional Defined-Contribution Pensions
The link between contributions of workers and their benefits when they are retired is important for both pension schemes. This link can be analyzed under two extreme plans. In the one extreme case, called defined-contribution plan, pensions (benefits) are determined by past contributions and the returns to those contributions. In this system, while contributions are defined and fixed, benefits of retirees are uncertain. On the other hand, in the defined-benefit plan, the height of the benefits for retirees is a set promised amount independent of future economic conditions.

Recently, a new pension plan called notional defined-contribution (NDC) plans is established. This plan combines PAYG scheme with funded defined contribution plan. [1](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/01/reforming-public-pensions) This pension plan has two distinctive characteristics compared to funded plan: interest rates on contributions are determined by government and the accumulation of savings is notional. In other words, workers finance pensions of current retirees by their savings, but their savings are credited on notional accounts. When these workers are retired, their pensions are determined by their past contributions. [2]( http://www.nber.org/chapters/c4533.pdf)

###Three Pillars of Pension System
The World Bank advises governments to design pension schemes which are divided into three pillars:[3](http://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2000/esa00dp13.pdf)
<ul>
<li>First Pillar: These pensions are financed by taxation on a pay-as-you-go basis that aims to reduce poverty in old age.</li>
<li>Second Pillar: This system consists of mandatory contributions for pensions and provides benefits only to contributors.</li>
<li>Third Pillar:  This system is similar to second pillar but participation for this pillar is voluntary so this includes typically private pension plan.</li>
</ul>
##Demographic Changes
###The Baby Boom
Many countries worldwide are currently experiencing an ageing population. This is due to factors such as a decline in fertility, the baby boom, longevity, and migration. Two years after the second world war, the birth rate spiked for many countries. The birth rate remained above average for twenty more years to come. This event is referred to as the baby boom. In turn, it implicates the rising concerns of ageing population since this “peak” of fertility is now reaching retirement age.

###Fertility Rate
Despite popular believes that the baby boomers are the main cause of an ageing population, this is not entirely true. The sharp drop in fertility rates from the 1970’s onwards is also a large contributor to the demographic changes. The main reason for this drop is the introduction of the contraceptive pill and the emancipation of women. In the Netherlands for instance the fertility rate in 1960 was 3.12 children per woman, while in 1975 it had already decreased to 1.66 - a very large difference. We see the same decrease in the USA (though less strong), China (even before the One-Child Policy was implemented) and many other countries. Countries with a high living standard have an especially low fertility rate. [4]( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?)

In developed countries, the replacement fertility rate is roughly two meaning that a woman needs to have, on average, two children in order to keep a stable population. In other words, when the fertility rate is below two, the population decreases. In developing countries, the replacement rate is often higher, between 2.5 and 3.3, due to higher mortality rates.

Currently the fertility rate in the Netherlands is 1.72 and therefore below the replacement rate. This is an event that is happening in most developed countries, which is also contributing to the ageing of the population.

###Longevity
Another force that contributes to the ageing population in many nations is the increased life expectancy or longevity. Because of better living conditions and healthcare, the life expectancy for most western nations started to increase from the mid-Nineteenth Century onwards. During this time period, it doubled to the point where children born today are expected to survive more than eighty years. [5]( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN)

Despite this sizeable increase in life expectancy the age of retirement from the end of the Second World War until recently has barely changed in most Western countries. In some cases, the retirement age even decreased in order to make room for younger workers. As a result, the years of retirement have increased by six years for the OECD countries. The decreasing fertility rate, increasing life expectancy and sluggish decision making with regards to eligibility for pension benefits, combined, are increasing the amount of money needed to sustain the current pension systems. With the current population growth, the ratio of workers per retiree will decrease to less than two in 2060 [6](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/european_economy/2012/pdf/ee-2012-2_en.pdf) for the European Union countries. Imagine that each family with two working parents not only have to take care of their children but also one retiree.

But how exactly do these problems manifest themselves? The impact of an ageing population on pensions is following.

##Government debt and pensions
Governments making use of the PAYG system sometimes use debt to fund its pensions, when income from taxes aimed at paying pensions doesn’t match its pension obligations (liabilities). Such tax income sometimes comes from dedicated revenues, general taxations or a mix of the two. In 2016, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) identifies 20 OECD countries with a debt of $78 trillion towards pensions [7](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/03/17/global-government-debt-is-actually-triple-what-we-thought-thanks-to-pensions/). This is $4,5 trillion more than the world’s GDP in 2015 [8](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD). This is especially problematic when a countries’ dedicated revenue outweighs its pension liabilities and when financial crisis occurs, both eventually leading to a pension crisis, as has been the case in Greece and Poland recently [9](http://www.wsj.com/articles/europe-faces-pension-predicament-1457287588).

Even if PAYG systems were to be sustainable, there is still the problem of wealth redistribution. More specifically, because of increased longevity, people live longer and hence have more time to consume, without contribution. To better understand, think of the total income or output generated by a country’s working population, of which a certain proportion has to go to the old generation (non-working) in order to ensure their pensions. If the old generation lives longer, it gets to consume more without participating in the economy, with the young having to contribute more towards pension sustenance. This form of welfare distribution is called intergenerational redistribution.

Pension systems are also subject to risks, ranging from macroeconomic shocks (such as a financial crisis) and political risks up to longevity risks (the risk of living longer than expected).  In addition, funded pension systems face the risk of poor performance due to mismanagement of funds. To counter these risks, various tools are being used, most of which are made up of some sort of governmental intervention, in an effort to redistribute the wealth where needed. However, in a pension system based on private savings, this becomes more difficult. In such cases, insurance companies aim at filling that gap. Such insurances are sometimes mandatory.

##Sustainable PAYG
Due to the increased burden on workers caused by the ageing population, politicians may favour changing the PAYG system to a funded system. However, transforming the current PAYG to funded system has many obstacles and the results are uncertain, in particular, when PAYG is well established and the economy is too big to easily make such a structural reform. It is therefore not surprising that many economists favor partial reforms rather than dismantling the whole PAYG scheme [10](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-246X.00122/abstract). The most common proposals how to make the pension system sustainable are the following:

###1) Higher contribution rate or lower benefits
Obviously, this is the basic straightforward way of how to solve any pressures in government budget. Nevertheless, any increase in compulsory payments is highly unpopular and therefore hardly obtains political support. After all, workers do not favor paying more for the elderly generation than they will ever receive themselves. From their point of view, private savings may seem to be much more profitable then [11](http://www.nber.org/papers/w6149). The same applies to lowering the retirement benefits.

###2) Increase in retirement age
A way of solving the government deficit is by increasing the retirement age. This way, people pay taxes for additional years and receive benefits for fewer years. Neither this solution is popular in society. Its main advantage is, however, that it may be accepted for its fairness. Considering the substantial increase in longevity during the past decades, holding the same age of retirement would mean more years of receiving pension benefits while the number of working years would be the same. Policies increasing the retirement age are adopted worldwide; either by one-shot decisions or as a long-term policy gradually increasing the limit according to changes in life expectancy [12](http://www.economist.com/node/2085219).

###3) Notional Defined Contribution
As already mentioned in the first section, this pension scheme takes over many advantages of funded pensions without obstacles and painful decisions related to full transformation. Since the size of benefits paid is flexible and dependent on the amount paid during lifetime, life expectancy and expected notional interest rate, such a system seems to be relatively fair and stable [13]( http://dare.uva.nl/cgi/arno/show.cgi?fid=133250).

###4) Increase the productivity of workers
This is indeed a desirable solution. Workers producing more are also paying more to the pensions’ budget without increasing the contribution rate. Unfortunately, increasing the productivity by various government policies has always been desirable for plenty of reasons, yet mostly with dubious results. It is also a costly long-term project, so there will be no immediate results for the pension system problems.

###5) Increase the number of workers
There are various ways how to reach this goal: from labor market policies lowering unemployment up to increasing retirement age as more former retirees are still working. Another way is to import foreign workers through relaxed immigration rules. Immigration of work force increases the working population in a country and it will be more likely that the jobs of the retirees are filled.

##Application
###Demographic transition of the Netherlands
In 2016, the Netherlands has around 17,000,000 people and around 16% of the population is elderly, meaning they are over 65 years [14](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb). After Second World War the population was almost doubled from 5.1 million to 10 million people due to baby boom effect. However, after that time, birth rates strongly decreased and life expectancy went up, causing a decline in population growth. The fertility rate is currently around 1.72 children per woman, meaning that the Netherlands have a decreasing natural population growth. However, paired with immigration numbers, the real population growth in 2015 was 4,6%.

###Pension system in the Netherlands
The Netherlands is known to have one of the world’s top ranking, sustainable pension systems [15](http://www.globalpensionindex.com/). The first pillar is a PAYG system and the second pillar generally follows a Notional DC scheme [16](http://www.actuaries.org/CTTEES_SOCSEC/Documents/27_Cichon.pdf). The majority of pension money is managed by pension funds (second pillar). Over 90% of Dutch have a pension scheme through their employers. There are around 80 industry pension funds and they control around 70% of total assets of Dutch pension funds of around 480 billion euro [17](https://pure.uvt.nl/portal/files/924069/KortlevePonds_Ch10_BundleFairValuePFmanagement.pdf).

Since the Dutch population, as in many other countries, is aging, the government needed to implement change to make the system sustainable. The retirement age has always been 65 years, but now it will be increased to 66 years in 2018 and 67 years in 2021. From 2022, the retirement age will be fully connected with life expectancy.

There are currently many debates in the Netherlands about what other changes can be made to lessen the burden for the working population, because the old system was simply unsustainable with such a fast aging population. Other changes discussed are for instance individual pension plans, in other words, pension plans where people save for themselves and not collectively.
